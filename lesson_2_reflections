What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When a repository is initialize git creates the neccesary files to keep
	track of the repository and its needed because without those files the 
	version control system can't keep track of the commits and changes made
	to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is different because this area only contains files that
	are going to be commited to the repository, the repository contains the
	files that we want to keep track in the version control system and the working
	directory can include files that are not being tracked in the version
	control system.
