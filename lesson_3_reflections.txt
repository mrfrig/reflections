When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	- When you are collaborating with a team on a project
	- When your making an open source project and you want help and feedback from other 
	  people
	- When you want a backup of your repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because if someone on your team makes a change to a file your currently working on 
	and that person push the changes to the remote repository, git will update your
	repository but your editor will not automatically update and when you save the
	changes you made to the file your will overwrite the changes the other person made.
